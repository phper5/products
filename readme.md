I usually read the framework code before I start. But this time I don't have so much time

I think maybe I am failed because it took me a long time. Could you give me some feedback on my weakness? Thank you very much

There is a part of the repetitive code, if I have time I think I can do it better. 

At the beginning, I use the login/view to show the login form and use login/create to check the data, but later from the userguide.
I know I can just use product/create for show the form and save the data, don't need two routes. 
But I have not  modify the login registration code.

Sorry, the git was a bit confusing at the beginning. master is the empty project, and task1 is exactly task2.. 
I noticed it when I did the task4. and also as I know there is a role field needed, I add it when I did the register in advance

when I did task4, I did not know what is the field status used for. so the crud just ignore the field.
but later when I did the task6 I know it is used for active product. need I re-code the crud to add this field?

the database please check db.sql
